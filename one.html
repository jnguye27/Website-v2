      <h2 id="s1" style="margin-top: 1.5%;">Food</h2>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 5vh;">
        Hamsters are nocturnal animals (asleep during the day and awake at night), therefore you should feed them 1-2 tablespoons of food per night.
        They're also omnivores, which means that they can eat a small mix of plants (vegetables, herbs, & seeds) and insects (dry/alive crickets & mealworms) for their diet (PetSmart, n.d.).
        Though, if you're on a budget, your hamster(s) could also just feed on pelleted foods and vegetables alone.
        It's important to note that after 4 hours of feeding, the bowl should be removed from the cage, or else your furry friend will begin stashing their food within their cheeks or bedding for "safety" (PetSmart, n.d.). This can cause the food to break down and rot in the cage without you even noticing.
        <br><br>As for the recommended meals, PetSmart says that you should give your hamster(s):
        <br>80% - Pelleted Foods that are at least 15-20% in protein
        <br>15% - Vegetables
        <br>5% - Treats
        <br>And a separate bottle and/or bowl of water that should be clean and available at all times.
        <br>Do not combine foods and treats together, your hamster will become picky and leave the high-fiber foods for the sugary treats.

        Treats can be given to your hamster(s) in small portions once or twice a week.
        <br>Treats can be defined as fruits, grass, and/or hay. They don't have to be packed with sugar to be considered a "treat".
        <br>Do NOT feed your hamster(s) citrus fruits such as oranges, lemons, or grapefruits because they're too high in acidity (PDSA, n.d.).
        <br>Consumption of citrus fruits can lead to dental and digestive issues like diarrhea.

      <!-- Toys Section -->
      <h2 id="s3">Toys</h2>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 5vh;">
        Like every pet, hamsters also love to play. What else will they do in their cage all day? They need to get rid of their energy somehow and that's usually through their toys. Here are a few things to carefully consider when buying toys for your hamster(s):
        <li style="margin-top: -2%;"> Does the toy meet my hamster's needs, giving them physical or mental stimulation?</li>
        <li> Is the toy low or high in quality? Will the toy last long? Is it eco-friendly and non-toxic?</li>
        <li> Is it easy to clean?</li>
        <li> Do I already have a similar toy? Will this new toy replace the old one?</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: -0.5%;"> Do they have too many toys within their cage already?</li>

        <p>
          * Reminder to think of quality over quantity, it's best to have a few toys that are higher in quality so that your hamster(s) can have space to play in.
          <br><br><b>Types of Hamster Toys</b>
          <br><br>Hamster Wheel: This is the most common toy for hamsters, sometimes they come as an addition to the cage itself. A plastic and silent wheel is best since they'll be awake at night using it. Your hamster needs a wheel that's the right size for their body, they shouldn't be bending on the wheel. A hamster on the larger side will require a wheel that's a minimum of 8 inches, while smaller hamsters should be around 5.5 inches (Griffiths, 2022).
          <br><br>Chew Toys: Your hamster(s) natural instinct is to gnaw on stuff. If you don't give your hamster anything to gnaw on, they might try to gnaw on you, your furniture, or the bars to their cage. Some budget alternatives for hamster toys can be household cardboard (from boxes to toilet paper) or wood, which should be untreated softwood that was baked and washed for your hamster's safety (PDSA, n.d.). Always make sure that the chew toy is sanitary and non-toxic since your hamster(s) might ingest bits of it.
          <br><br>Hamster Balls: In theory, these devices are great for exercise, but in reality, they're not the best idea. Although hamsters like to explore, they feel stressed when they're put into cramped areas. It's better to just expand your cage and allow them to explore a bigger (and safer) space (Griffiths, 2022). If you decide to let your hamster travel outside of their cage in a hamster ball, heavily supervise and fortify the area to be hamster-proof because a drop from a few flights of stairs, for example, can easily give them a serious concussion.
          <br><br>Climbing Toys: Of course hamsters love to climb, they're curious beings. The problem is that hamsters have poor eyesight so tunnels, tubes, and bendy bridges will be good choices while climbing ladders won't be (Griffiths, 2022).
          <br><br>Digging Toys: Hamsters love to play hide ' n ' seek. Try to provide them with a deep layer of sawdust or potting compost at the bottom of their cage (Griffiths, 2022). A digging tower that's made out of wood is also a good option, it's a specific area for hamsters to burrow (Griffiths, 2022).

      <p>
        Luckily for you, you do not need to groom your hamster(s) since they can independently groom themselves daily (PetSmart, n.d.). You'll only need to help your hamster(s) if they're getting a bit too old to groom themselves, they're currently ill, and/or their matted fur is getting out of hand.
        That being said, please wash your hands with soap and warm water at all times when coming into contact with your hamster, their habitat, and/or their food in case of bacteria or diseases.

      <!-- Housing Section -->
      <h2 id="s5">Housing</h2>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 5vh;">
        Hamsters need dark, big, dry, clean, and quiet homes where they'll be able to explore and do their daily activities without feeling any stress from outside factors (RSPCA, n.d.).
        <br>Focusing on the cage itself, it's common for hamsters to have a home with barred walls and solid flooring. Their cage needs to be secure and sturdy so that any other pets, visitors, or roommates can't accidentally harm them.
        Their home also needs to be large enough so that they won't develop "Cage Rage". A condition that is caused by stress overload, which can develop into behavioral issues like biting (which can damage their teeth) or excessive urination (PETA, 2021).
        It's required that hamsters on the larger side have 800+ square inches of space while hamsters on the smaller side should have 640+. Take note that pet stores usually don't meet these requirements so it's recommended to build your own custom hamster enclosure (PETA, 2021).
        Also, make sure that the spacing between the bars of the cage aren't too big, or else your hamster(s) can squeeze through the gaps to escape!
