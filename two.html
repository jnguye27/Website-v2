      <h2 id="s1" style="margin-top: 1.5%;">How to Raise a Hamster</h2>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 5vh;">
        Everyone has their way of raising things but if you're lost and new to owning hamsters then maybe we can give you a few tips and tricks to help you out! You may know the basics of keeping a hamster alive (like how they need food, water, a cage, and a few toys), but you might not know how to begin bonding with one. So, we'll teach you!
        <p style="margin-top: -1%; text-indent: 2%;">
          When you first bring your new hamster home, you need to make sure that the environment is peaceful. It has to be a home that's quiet, dark, and away from any possible means of escape! When you're not bonding and socializing with your hamster, place a cloth over its cage so that it'll focus on exploring its new home instead of worrying about what's outside of it. After a few days, when it's getting used to the sounds and sights, you can begin to handle them with a firm grip. They might try to nip you at first out of fear, but after seeing you give them food and water every day, they'll begin to trust you. After a while, give them a variety of food because you wouldn't want to eat the same thing every day do you? When they've become comfortable with you and their new home, you can begin cleaning their cage and giving them space outside of their cage to play (with heavy supervision of course).

      <h2 id="s2">Easiest Breeds to Raise</h2>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 5vh;">
        There are many hamsters out there that need homes, about 24 species of them (Puisis, 2022), but some of them need more attention and knowledge from their owners than others to live a happy and healthy life. For starters, some hamsters like to be alone most of the time while others want company. Some like being petted and touched by their owners while others do not.
        <br><br><b>Here are the top 5 easiest hamster breeds to raise:</b>
        <ol style="margin-top: -1.5%;">
          <li>Syrian Hamsters: They're also known as Goldens or Teddy Bear hamsters because they're the most friendly and loving hamsters towards their family (Puisis, 2022). Though towards strangers and other hamsters after 10 weeks of age, they're not as social. Their average lifespan is 2 - 3 years (Butcher, 2021).</li>
          <br><li>Dwarf Campbell Russian Hamsters: They're social to both people and same-sex hamsters as long as they were socialized properly at a young age. These hamsters are not suitable for young children because they're less comfortable with touch, therefore more prone to nipping when nervous (Puisis, 2022). Their average lifespan is 1.5 - 2 years (Butcher, 2021). </li>
          <br><li>Roborovski Dwarf Hamsters: These energetic hamsters are both friendly and great at handling. Even in nervous situations, they will not nip. The only downside is that these hamsters do not like sharing (Puisis, 2022)! So if you're wanting to get multiple Roborovski Dwarf Hamsters, buy multiples of everything. Their average lifespan is 3 - 3.5 years (Butcher, 2021).</li>
          <br><li>Dwarf Winter White Russian Hamsters: They're also known as Siberian Hamsters or Djungarian Hamsters because they come from colder climates (Puisis, 2022). When handled by children, please supervise carefully. These guys are escape artists! They will run fast and hide well when nervous. They're sociable animals and can live with same-sex hamsters as long as the area is spacious (Puisis, 2022). The only issue with these hamsters is that they are quite small and can easily fit through the bars of a cage to escape, so consider buying a tank instead (Puisis, 2022). Their average lifespan is approximately 2 years (Butcher, 2021).</li>
          <br><li>Chinese Hamsters: Like the others, they're very friendly and okay with handling as long as they were raised to be so. They like to squirm a lot when being handled and are fast little creatures, so it's important that you firmly grip them when you're holding them (Puisis, 2022). They can also handle being around other same-sex Chinese hamsters. Their average lifespan is 3 years (Butcher, 2021).</li>

      <h2 id="s3">Hypoallergenic Hamsters</h2>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 5vh;">
        Being allergic or not to hamsters is up to the person's body. The issue can't be fixed by owning a certain hamster breed. Hamsters are common household pets that are great for people with allergies in general because they live in confined spaces where they're unable to shed and spread their loose fur all over the person. This can be said for all confined pets like gerbils, guinea pigs, mice, chinchillas, and rats (13 Hypoallergenic Pets For People With Allergies, n.d.).

      <!-- Common Health Problems Section -->
      <h2 id="s4">Common Health Problems</h2>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 5vh;">
        Like all living things, hamsters are also vulnerable to developing health problems over their lifetime. Depending on their breed, their lifespan can go up to 2-3 years of life. The most common illnesses that hamsters can obtain are skin, digestive, or respiratory diseases (Whitney, 2022). See a veterinarian when your hamster(s) aren't eating or being as active as they use to be.
        <br><br><b>Skin Disorders</b>
        <br><br>Skin Diseases: Unlike bigger pets, hamsters are not required to have vaccinations which cause them to be more susceptible to mite infestations and ringworms (Editorial, 2021). Hamsters can also develop allergies and skin infections when touching, for example, cedar bedding (Editorial, 2021).
        <br><br>Abscesses (lump of pus): Since hamsters are fragile creatures they can easily get cuts on their skin. If it's not properly treated, it will develop into an abscess (Editorial, 2021). The only solution then is to have a professional treat it.
        <br><br>Hair Loss: When a hamster develops a lot of bald spots, there can be a number of reasons. It could be caused by friction against their cages/feeders, physical fights against other hamsters, or hidden infections (Editorial, 2021).
        <br><br><b>Digestive Disorders</b>
        <br><br>Diarrhea (also known as "Wet Tail"): Is commonly found in young hamsters. It's caused by induced stress when they're being transported, living in cramped areas, given surgery, heavily ill, or have dietary changes (Editorial, 2021). The most common symptoms of diarrhea are when their fur is wet or matted around the tail and belly, they have low energy levels, a loss of appetite, and a lot of weight loss (Editorial, 2021). A wet tail causes hamsters to be dehydrated, so it's important to give them enough water to drink and stop any new dietary changes until a veterinarian is seen as soon as possible.
        <br><br>Diabetes: Like humans, diabetes happens when the body doesn't produce enough insulin or doesn't utilize it properly. Dwarf hamsters are more prone to this issue because they have smaller bodies. Common signs of diabetes are excessive thirst and urination, although, these symptoms can also indicate other issues like a kidney or bladder infection (Editorial, 2021). Please see a veterinarian as soon as possible if your hamster shows these symptoms. Diabetes usually links to obesity so cut down on the amount of high-fat or sugary foods (Editorial, 2021).
        <br><br><b>Other Common Disorders</b>
        <br><br>Respiratory Infections: Hamsters can catch pneumonia from humans. This causes them to sneeze, wheeze, and have runny noses (Editorial, 2021). See a veterinarian if their eyes or nose are leaking discharge (Editorial, 2021).
        <br><br>Dental Problems: Happens when the hamster isn't given proper care or access to chewing toys. A hamster's teeth will always grow throughout its life. Having a lack of gnawing material causes them to never wear out (Editorial, 2021). Over time, a hamster's bottom teeth can reach their nasal cavity and cause them to drool, eat less, have weight loss, and have bad breath (Editorial, 2021). Visit a veterinarian to have their teeth trimmed every once in a while.
        <br><br>Aging: Once your hamster is over a year old, they'll begin to develop geriatric diseases that affect their organ functionality (Editorial, 2021). These diseases can't be cured but can be managed.
